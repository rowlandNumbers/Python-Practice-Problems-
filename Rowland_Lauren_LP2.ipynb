    "### Calculating an Average\n",
    "Determining the average of a group of values is a simple calculation: add all of the values then divide the sum by the number of values. Although this is a straightforward calculation, it is easy to make a mistake when writing a program that calculates an average. For example, letâ€™s assume that the variables a, b, and c each hold a value and we want to calculate the average of those values. If we are careless, we might write a statement such as the following to perform the calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    average = a + b + c / 3.0\n",
    "    \n",
    "Can you see the error in this statement? When it executes, the division will take place first. The value in c will be divided by 3, then the result will be added to a + b. That is not the correct way to calculate an average. To correct this error, we need to put parentheses around a + b + c, as shown here:\n",
    "\n",
    "    average = (a + b + c) / 3.0\n",
